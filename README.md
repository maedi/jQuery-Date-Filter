# jQuery Date Filter

jQuery Date Filter is a tiny library that does one thing; filter content by current date. This is useful for static sites generated by Jekyll where time based content isn't removed until the site is rebuilt. I use jQuery Date Filter on my [homepage](http://maedi.com) to hide past events (upcoming gigs). Now I don't have to rebuild my site to remove a past event!

## How to use

Add a "data-date-filter" attribute to any element with the value set as a date:

{% highlight html %}
  {% raw %}
    <li data-date-filter="{{post.date}}">
  {% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The date format expected is a datetime which Jekyll will output by default.

Then call the library like so:

{% highlight js %}
  $('li').dateFilter();
{% endhighlight %}

If an item's date is in the past then this item will be removed from the DOM. By default a buffer of 1 day is removed from the cutoff date, so an event starting at 0:00 today wont be removed until 0:00 tomorrow.

## Configuration options

| Name       | Default value      | Description                                |
|:-----------|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| `cutoff`   | Current datetime   | Remove item(s) after this date.            |
| `buffer`   | `-1`               | Days to decrease or increase cutoff by.    |
| `emptyText`| Sorry, no results. | Text to show when there are no items.      |
